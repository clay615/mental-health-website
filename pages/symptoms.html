        <h2> Categories of Mental Health Issues </h2>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several mental health 
                illnesses that go unnoticed due 
                to our lack of awareness surrounding
                their symptoms.  This can be dangerous 
                for some illnesses such as schizophrenia.
                For others, such as depressive disorders,
                this can result in people harming themselves.
            </p>

        <h3> Psychotic Disorders</h3>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Psychotic Disorders, such as 
                schizophrenia, are disorders where
                the person loses their touch with reality, 
                often seeing figures and hearing voices.
            </p>

        <h3> Depressive Disorders</h3>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depressive Disorders occur when there 
                is a chemical imbalance in the brain
                that makes it difficult for the brain
                to produce equal hormones, causing a 
                constant emptiness or sadness.
            </p>

        <h3> Anxiety Disorders </h3>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anxiety Disorders are characterized as 
                a constant stress.  This 
                can come in many forms.
                Social anxiety, a common disorder, causes
                stress when put in socials. OCD on 
                the other hand is an irrational need for 
                certain rituals with the fear of reprecussions
                if ignored.
