                        illnesses that go unnoticed due 
                        to our lack of awareness surrounding
                        their symptoms.  This can be dangerous 
                        for some illnesses such as schizophrenia.
                        For others, such as depressive disorders,
                        this can result to people harming theirselves.

                        that makes it difficult for the brain
                        to produce equal hormones, causing a 
                        constant emptiness or sadness.
