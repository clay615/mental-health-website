                    <h2> General </h2>
                        <p>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avoid the blame game: While we may wonder why 
                            they might feel a certain way, we do not need to know to give help. 
                            Instead of blaming certain things in their life or past, (such as phone 
                            usage, a traumatic event, or a bad relationship) instead, focus on 
                            what you know helps and doesnt help the person.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relate: Find ways to relate to this person even 
                            if you do not understand their struggle completely. Ask non-invasive 
                            questions when comparing moments in your life you may have felt similar. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let them know you are there: Even when others 
                            are angry, sad, or confused, a simple gesture such as reminding them 
                            every day that you care for them and are there judgement free, can help 
                            make it easier to cope, as well as a reason to get better. 
                        </p>

                <div>
                    <h2> Self Harm </h2>
                        <p>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dont take away Choice: Self harm can be an 
                            outlet when a person has few choices in their life.  While you may 
                            think you are preventing further injury by removing possible tools, it 
                            may cause the person doing it to feel an even stronger urge to harm 
                            themselves.  Instead, ask and persuade rather than demand.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avoid negative Language choices: Do not use 
                            words as, "attention seeking," or saying stuff such as, "you have nothing to 
                            be upset about." These people may have issues expressing their feelings 
                            and would rather close up than explain themselves.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offer Methods: Offer different coping mechanisms 
                            that may be safer. Some common ones are using red dye, slashing 
                            pillows/plastic etc. and snapping rubber bands against the areas they 
                            wish to hurt themselves.

                        <p>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reinforce Positive associations: Do not make 
                            comments about people being fat or eating too much. Avoid other comments 
                            such as praising their condition if it is unhealthy. Instead, associate 
                            food with happiness. When you eat together, use language that is worry 
                            free and happy.  Encourage focus on a healthy balanced diet.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research: An effective method is to sit down 
                            with the person and research the negative effects of eating disorders 
                            and the better alternatives.  Introduce and read up on a healthy 
                            balanced diet, and calorie deficits.  
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;REMEMBER: An eating disorder is not strictly 
                            starving ones self, binging and stress eating are also eating disorders. 
                            An eating disorder is simply an unhealthy relationship with food. Just 
                            because someone may not have the most common types of ED's does not mean 
                            they dont have one at all.

                        <p>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Help set up a plan: Sit down with your loved 
                            one and create a plan for recovery and regular interventions. Set 
                            certain goals that are achievable and incremental. Do not set a goal of 
                            being sober by the end of the year if they are a longtime user.  Instead, 
                            go month by month and slowly build up their sobriety.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put it in perspective: while remaining calm and caring, 
                            make it clear to your loved one the negative effects their addiction is having 
                            on their family and friends. Love for one another can be a powerful motivator 
                            to get sober.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surround with positivity: Try and convince your loved 
                            one to stay away from bad influences and stressors.  If a certain friend upsets 
                            them on a daily basis, encourage them to cut contact and focus on their recovery. 
                            Unnecessary stress can cause relapsing to look less like a setback and make recovery 
                            more difficult.

                                -Ask: Ask what their issue is, the severity of it, and any other questions that may help you gather relevant information.
                                <br>
                                -Be there: Comfort and support the person as you or someone else gets into contact with the appropriate channels.

                                -Help keep them safe: While help is on the way, keep the person as calm and safe as you can. Watch for signs of harming themselves or others.

                                -Help them Connect: Help them contact and speak to the help they need, whether this be in person, over the phone, or by setting up appointments.
                                <br>
                                -Follow up: Following up with a person after their crisis reinforces that you are there for them and you care.

                        <h2> What if They Don't Want Help? </h2>
                            <p>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This applies to situations where an individual is not going to hurt themselves or others. Some people may be resistant to help:
                                Give Options: If a person doesnt want to receive help due to a certain aspect, ask them what they would want to get mental health wise thats closest.
                                Ask questions: Find out why they are resistant to help without pushing them to the point of distrust.
                                Be there: Simply listening to their issues may be the furthest mental health help they will obtain, and even so, that can be the best thing for some people.
                                Let them decide: Most importantly, do not force them into any certain decisions or recoveries. It is most beneficial when someone decides they want help themselves.
                                TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF: Do not hesitate to step back and tell them so when you feel you are being brought down to. You are of more help to people when you are mentally okay, so don't drain yourself. If helping someone doesnt work, do not blame yourself.
