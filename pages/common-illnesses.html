            <h1> Origins </h1>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though not every person has the same 
                    story and past surrounding their mental 
                    illnesses, we can look at the most common factors
                    associated with each illness and try to establish the 
                    most common reason for their development.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several reasons that mental illnesses 
                    may develop. Some of these are environmental factors
                    the person had grown up with or currently lives with.
                    There are also genetic factors. Some illnesses are passed
                    down from parents. There are also chemical reasons, such as unnatural imbalances
                    in the brain. 
                    

                </p>
            </div>

            <div class = "box">
            <h1> Demographics </h1>
                <p> 
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another interesting part of mental illnesses 
                    is that they effect demographics. This is due to the factors
                    mentioned in the "Origins" section.  
                    Some illnesses are more prevalant in women than men. 
                    Others are more so in men than women.  Gender, race, and background
                    are all factors that can contribute to mental illness.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though they can be factors, they arent the sole reason. If 
                    someone does not fit the usual demographics for a mental 
                    illness, that does not mean they do not have that illness.
                    Demographics are simply pattterns that are observed, not a rule book.
