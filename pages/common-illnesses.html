                <h1> Origins </h1>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though not every person has the same 
                        story and past surrounding their mental 
                        illnesses, we can look at the most common factors
                        associated with each illness and try to establish the 
                        most common reason for their development.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several reasons that mental illnesses 
                        may develop. Some of these are environmental factors
                        the person had grown up with or currently lives with.
                        There are also genetic factors. Some illnesses are passed
                        down from parents. There are also chemical reasons, such as unnatural imbalances
                        in the brain. 
                    </p>
            </div>

            <div class = "box">
                <h1> Demographics </h1>
                    <p> 
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another interesting part of mental illnesses 
                        is that they effect demographics. This is due to the factors
                        mentioned in the "Origins" section.  
                        Some illnesses are more prevalant in women than men. 
                        Others are more so in men than women.  Gender, race, and background
                        are all factors that can contribute to mental illness.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though they can be factors, they arent the sole reason. If 
                        someone does not fit the usual demographics for a mental 
                        illness, that does not mean they do not have that illness.
                        Demographics are simply pattterns that are observed, not a rule book.
