                <h1> Benefits of Donating to Charities/Research benefits </h1>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before you donate, you probably want to know what your money will be helping with. 
                        When you donate money to these charities, you are helping fund treatment for those who 
                        suffer from mental illnesses. Your money can also be used to research better treatment 
                        options for many different mental illnesses.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money you give to charities is used to help pay for peoples access to free 
                        mental health services, such as hotlines, therapy, and sponserships.
                        The money given to research is used to help advance our knowledge about mental 
                        disorders, as well as treat it.
