                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coping is different for everyone, 
                            and someone may be coping in an unhealthy 
                            way. Sometimes it is easy to notice, such
                            as cutting, sometimes it is less obvious 
                            such as seeking attention.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of healthy coping mechanisms is to directly
                            stop the unhealthy coping and replace it with beneficial 
                            yet effective methods. Find other ways to safely take out anger, 
                            frustration, sadness, and other negative emotions.
