                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, and welcome to our mental health awareness page. Before we get started, did you know that, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI),  almost 23.4% of adults suffer from mental illnesses which is 1 in 5 adults, with 14.3% of 10 to 19 year olds having mental illnesses? 50% of all lifetime mental illness begins by age 14, and 75% by age 24. Which really shows how vulnerable younger people are to mental illness. That is why it is so important to know the signs and symptoms of mental illnesses as early as possible. This awareness makes it easier for people to recognize and seek treatment for their own, or others, issues.

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All too often, people discover that their peers, or themselves, 
                            have issues that they struggle with alone.  This 
                            sometimes is discovered too late, after someone
                            has already harmed themselves or others.  
                            By educating yourself, your friends, students, 
                            children, and fellow citizens, we can make sure
                            our peers know we are there for them.

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tricky part about mental health is that it 
                            manifests differently person by person. No two cases 
                            are identical.

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important for you to check in on 
                            your friends, as well as yourself.  If 
                            you feel judged or scared to speak to your 
                            loved ones, we have resources at your disposal.

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mental health is not something to be ashamed of,
                            everybody struggles with it, though some quieter 
                            than others.
