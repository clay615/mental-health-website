                            All too often, people discover that their peers, or themselves, 
                            have issues that they struggle with alone.  This 
                            sometimes is discovered too late, after someone
                            has already harmed themselves or others.  
                            By educating yourself, your friends, students, 
                            children, and fellow citizens, we can make sure
                            our peers know we are there for them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is important for you to check in on 
                            your friends, as well as yourself.  If 
                            you feel judged or scared to speak to your 
                            loved ones, we have resources at your disposal.

                            Mental health is not something to be ashamed of,
                            everybody struggles with it, though some quieter 
                            than others.
