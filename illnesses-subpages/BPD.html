                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some common symptoms of BPD are elevated 
                    mood, reduced amounts of sleep, drastically reduced and improved self confidence, 
                    racing thoughts, and very heavy impulsivity. BPD can also cause darastic mood 
                    shifts. People suffering from BPD often go "manic."
                    This is a short period of time where they disregard logic, eventually feeling 
                    a crash as this "high" wears down.

            <h1> What Causes BPD </h1>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bipolar Disorder can be caused by childhood 
                    neglect, major amounts of stress, 
                    drug use, and sleep disruption. BPD can be affected by genetics too, and while 
                    this doesn't mean you will have BPD just because your parents do. If your family 
                    has a history of BPD there could possibly be an increased chance of you 
                    developing BPD. As such, if your family has a history and you feel some of the symptoms, 
                    it is important to try and contact a psychologist aboit these issues. BPD can harm yourself and \
                    your relationships with others.
                </p>

            <h1> Demographics Affected </h1>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around 1.6% of people have BPD. Around 
                    4-5% of people will experience BPD at some point during their lives. BPD is 
                    most commonly diagnosed in the late teens or early twenties. Women will 
                    typically not develop BPD till slightly later in life relative to men.
                    People who suffer from BPD often suffer from other disorders and ailments, including drug addictions and 
                    eating disorders.
