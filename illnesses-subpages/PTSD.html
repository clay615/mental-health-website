                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PTSD causes the re-living of very traumatic moments. Triggers, such as loud 
                    sounds, bright bursts of light, and other sudden events can trigger the PTSD. 
                    PTSD can cause those suffering from it to be hypervigilant, blame themself 
                    for the traumatic event, not trust others, and emotional outbursts.
                    These outbursts can sometimes turn violent, as the person experiencing it is 
                    typically in a fight or flight response. Many people suffering from PTSD 
                    report not recognizing their loved ones in these fits.

            <h1> What Causes PTSD </h1>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  PTSD is typically caused by traumatizing 
                    memories and brain injuries. Some common causes of PTSD are physical and sexual assualt, horrific 
                    scenes, combat or war, and the sudden death of loved ones.
                    Outbursts can be caused by reliving even just a glimpse of the traumatizing memory.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PTSD can be developed during any stage of life. Some people may experience it while 
                    they are young, others while they are much older. According to Erase PTSD now, sexual PTSD is not rare with 
                    veterans either, and is the realities of many male and female veterans.

            <h1> Demographics Affected </h1>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roughly 3.9% of people have PTSD. One of 
                    the msot common causes of PTSD is war. Many people in war will see gruesome 
                    sights, get badly injured, or go through another scary event, which can cause 
                    PTSD. Another leading cause is PTSD is car accidents. Car accidents can happen 
                    suddenly, and can be very dangerous, which is why it can lead to car crash 
                    victims having PTSD.  It is just as easily triggered, considering how common 
                    cars are in everyday life, even if you do not personally use them. PTSD surrounding 
                    sexual assualt makes it difficult to develop healthy relationships and may cause the view 
                    of relationships to warp.
