                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schizophrenia is one of the more common mental illnesses, which can cause sensory hallucinations. 
                    It can cause delusions, make it difficult to think straight, reduce the ability to socialize, and 
                    cause attention and memory issues. A hallucination is an auditory, visual, or other sensory experience 
                    that causes you to believe you are experiencing something that isn’t real. The most common type of 
                    hallucination caused by schizophrenia is auditory, and will cause people to believe they are hearing 
                    voices that are not actually real. People who experience hallucinations won’t realize that they aren’t 
                    real, and can go long periods of times hearing voices before anybody notices.

            <h1> What Causes Schizophrenia </h1>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schizophrenia typically unfolds over time, 
                    through a combination of genetic vulnerability, brain development, and 
                    environmental influences.

                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About 1% of the population has 
                    Schizophrenia, with men being more likely to develop it when they're in 
                    their late teens while women show signs in their late twenties to early 
                    thirties.
