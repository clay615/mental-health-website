                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schizophrenia is one of the more common mental illnesses, which can cause sensory 
                        hallucinations. It can cause delusions, make it difficult to think straight, reduce the ability to socialize, and 
                        cause attention and memory issues. A hallucination is an auditory, visual, or other sensory experience 
                        that causes you to believe you are experiencing something that isn’t real. The most common type of 
                        hallucination caused by schizophrenia is auditory, and will cause people to believe they are hearing 
                        voices that are not actually real. People who experience hallucinations won’t realize that they aren’t 
                        real, and can go long periods of times hearing voices before anybody notices.

                <h1> What Causes Schizophrenia </h1>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schizophrenia typically unfolds over time, 
                        through a combination of genetic vulnerability, brain development, and 
                        environmental influences. Prenatal and early life stress can both be contributing factors.
                        The development of schizophrenia is still widely unknown, as it is hard to pinpoint 
                        when someone may be struggling with it. Though it is believed genetics is a factor, it 
                        is not a single gene that causes the disorder, rather having that gene increases the risk.
                        There are signs that brain structure may also be a factor of schizophrenia, however it is still 
                        being researched.

                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About 1% of the population has 
                        Schizophrenia, with men being more likely to develop it when they're in 
                        their late teens while women show signs in their late twenties to early 
                        thirties. 4.9% of people suffering from schizophrenia resort to suicide. This 
                        can be due to the many symptoms of the disorder such as the isolation, distrust, and hallucinations.
