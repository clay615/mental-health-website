            <h1> MDD(Major Depressive Disorder) </h1>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major Depressive Disorder is a common disorder. It is the result of a 
                    chemical imbalance in the brain.  The imbalance makes it difficult for the person to 
                    regulate their emotions. Common symptoms of MDD are persistent 
                    sadness, heavy loss of interest, feelings of worthlessness and/or guilt, and 
                    hopelessness. MDD is a constant sadness, not to be confused with being sad, 
                    which is temporary.

            <h1> What Causes MDD </h1>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many different ways MDD can form, 
                    but around 8.3% of adults have had MDD. MDD is partially a genetic illness, but 
                    can occur if depression goes untreated, and gets much worse. It is a chemical imbalance 
                    in the brain, causing uncommon reactions to stimuli, much like depression. Although it is a chemical imbalance,
                    environmental factors can cause it to worsen.

            <h1> Demographics Affected </h1>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16% of females have MDD while 10% of males 
                    have MDD. Approximately 21.0 million adults in the U.S. had at least one major 
                    depressive episode in 2021, representing 8.3% of all U.S. Females are more prone to the disorder than males.
                    It is most common in young adults aged 18-25 according to NIMH. It is also most common 
                    in people who have 2 or more races, being 13.9% of individuals.
                    61% of US adults who are suffering with MDD reached out and got help.
                    20% of the US population aged 12-17 have had atleast one MDD episode. That is around 
                    5.0 million adolescents. It was more common in girls than boys.
