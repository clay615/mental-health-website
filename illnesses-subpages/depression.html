            <h1> What Causes MDD </h1>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many different ways MDD can form, 
                    but around 8.3% of adults have had MDD. MDD is partially a genetic illness, but 
                    can occur if depression goes untreated, and gets much worse. It is a chemical imbalance 
                    in the brain, causing uncommon reactions to stimuli, much like depression. Although it is a chemical imbalance,
                    environmental factors can cause it to worsen.

            <h1> Demographics Affected </h1>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16% of females have MDD while 10% of males 
                    have MDD. Approximately 21.0 million adults in the U.S. had at least one major 
                    depressive episode in 2021, representing 8.3% of all U.S. Females are more prone to the disorder than males.
                    It is most common in young adults aged 18-25 according to NIMH. It is also most common 
                    in people who have 2 or more races, being 13.9% of individuals.
                    61% of US adults who are suffering with MDD reached out and got help.
