            <h1> OCD(Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder)</h1>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OCD is an often mischaracterized disorder. Often 
                    potrayed as being a disorder surrounding tidiness, it is in reality much different. 
                    OCD is a condition that causes a person to do irrational things, that may in the moment seem sudden, 
                    with fear of some kind of negative reaction if they fail to do so. This is typically followed by 
                    intrusive thoughts.  An example would be someone getting the irrational need to 
                    wash their hands 10 times before touching a bowl, not because they are a germaphobe, but out of fear 
                    of a bad situation, such as death or harm to themselves or loved one, occuring.

            <h1> What Causes OCD </h1>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neurological trauma and genetics can 
                    cause a person to develop OCD. It can be worsened, or triggered by 
                    environmental triggers, such as trauma, stress, or childhood events.
                    There are ranges to OCD, such as mild, moderate, and severe. According to the National Institue of 
                    Mental Health (NIMH), of the adults who suffer from OCD, only 34.8% had moderate, and 14.6% with mild.
                    Over half (50.6%) of these adults suffered from serious impairment.
                    The obsessive aspect of the disorder is these intrusive thoughts that stress 
                    the person out. The person then compulsively does something, typically a repeated habit, as 
                    a way of releasing stress.

            <h1> Demographics Affected </h1>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About 2.5% of the population is affected 
                    with OCD, with men making up 1%, and women making up the other 1.5%. Women 
                    have a higher rate of the disorder than men. It is more commonly developed in 
                    childhood for men, and in adolesence for women. Though women are predominantly 
                    more effected by the disorder, there is no conclusive difference in 
                    the outcome of treatment for male and female patients.
